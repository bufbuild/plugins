# plugins

## Description

This repository contains plugins published to the Buf Schema Registry.
Each plugin consists of a `buf.plugin.yaml` file containing metadata and a `Dockerfile` used to build and publish the plugin for remote execution.
Plugins are uniquely identified by the combination of the `name` and `plugin_version` specified in `buf.plugin.yaml` and an auto-generated revision which is incremented each time a modified plugin is pushed to the BSR.

If you'd like a Protobuf plugin to be added to the Buf Schema Registry, open an issue using the 'Plugin Request for Buf Schema Registry' issue template and our team will follow up.
